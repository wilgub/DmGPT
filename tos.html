<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<p>Last updated: 2026-01-23</p>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>
By using this Discord bot (“the Service”), you agree to these Terms of Service.
If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
</p>

<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
<p>
You must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and be legally allowed to use the Service in your country.
</p>

<h2>3. Paid Tiers</h2>
<p>
Some features are provided through paid subscription tiers. Limits, features, and pricing may change at any time.
</p>

<h2>4. Unlimited Plans and Fair Use</h2>
<p>
If you subscribe to an “unlimited” plan (including InfiniteGPT), “unlimited” refers to message-count access under normal,
human usage. Unlimited plans are still subject to reasonable fair-use limits designed to protect service stability and costs.
These limits may include (without limitation): rate limits, token or output caps, automated abuse detection, and other technical safeguards.
</p>
<p>
You may not use the Service in a way that is automated, scripted, excessively repetitive, intended to stress infrastructure,
or otherwise abusive. We may throttle, restrict, or suspend access if we detect usage patterns consistent with automation, exploitation,
or unreasonable resource consumption.
</p>

<h2>5. Revocation of Access</h2>
<p>
We reserve the right to revoke, suspend, limit, or terminate access to the Service at any time, for any reason, with or without notice.
</p>
<p>
This includes situations where we reasonably suspect abuse, fraud, exploitation, malicious intent, attempts to bypass safeguards,
or any other suspicious activity. We may take action even if the activity is not proven, where doing so is necessary
to protect the Service, users, or operational costs.
</p>
<p>
If access is revoked, no refund is required or guaranteed, including for active subscriptions.
</p>

<h2>6. Appeals</h2>
<p>
If your access is restricted or terminated, you may appeal by contacting the bot owner via the official support server.
Appeals are reviewed at our discretion. We may request additional information to verify identity or clarify usage patterns.
We are not obligated to reinstate access, and we may deny an appeal for any reason.
</p>

<h2>7. Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>
You may not use the Service to generate or facilitate:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hate speech or harassment</li>
  <li>Illegal content</li>
  <li>Malware, exploitation, or abuse</li>
  <li>Attempts to bypass safeguards or moderation</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. No Warranty</h2>
<p>
The Service is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind.
We do not guarantee uptime, accuracy, or availability.
</p>

<h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
We are not liable for any damages resulting from the use or inability to use the Service.
</p>

<h2>10. Changes</h2>
<p>
We may update these terms at any time. Continued use means acceptance of changes.
</p>

<h2>11. Contact</h2>
<p>
For questions, contact the bot owner via the official support server.
